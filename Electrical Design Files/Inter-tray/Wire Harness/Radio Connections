Recievers
	I) DSUB
		1) COS - Carrier Operated Switch - This is meant for repeating the signal i.e. this goes high when it recieves input (meant to power another transmitter)
		2) Disc - For building a discriminator meter - this hovers around the center scale and then deflects when you pass a signal - probably used for tuning the variable inductors
		3) B+ - Power (13.6V)
		4) SPKR  - For Driving a Speaker //Unecessary
	II) Other
		1) Antenna Input - RCA Plug input
		3) AF - Audio Out - SMA Connector
	
Transmitters
	I) DSub
		1) B+/E1  - Power 13.6V Variable depending on signal power out required 
					(Controlled in tray 2)
		2) Oven/E4 - 13.6 V - Always on during transmission periods
		3) Gnd /E3 - Ground
	II) Other
		1) AF input/E2 - Audio Input (SMA connector)
		2) Antenna Output - RCA Plug
