BOARD DESCRIPTION
	2 Copies of three indepedent RF circuits (~437 MHz)
		CC1120 Transceiver Circuit
		RF5110G Amplifier Circuit
		SWITCH Circuit

FABRICATION NOTES
	Could not add component designators to silk screen because of density
	DFM check needs to be done
	
ASSEMBLY NOTES
	Passives on the PCB will be assembled by UTAT
	We request microart assemble the main chips and SMA connector below. These are included on the BOM
	We have RF5110G and CC1120 chips on hand, we can ship these chips if that is helpful
	
	Main CHIPS
		RF Microdevices RF5110G
		Texas Instruments CC1120
		Skyworks SKY13299-321LF
		
	SMA CONNECTOR
		Generic FEMALE 50 OHM SMD Straight connector
			EXAMPLE: SMA-10V21-TGG
