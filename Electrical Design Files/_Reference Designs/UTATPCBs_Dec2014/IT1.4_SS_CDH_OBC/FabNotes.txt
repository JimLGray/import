FABRICATION NOTES
	If through-hole is a hassle to place/solder, connectors can be switched to surface-mount equivalents on request
	Many small silkscreen clearance violations - if this is an issue, please notify
	Panelization not done - under minimum size & can be panelized with other designs for easier board fab at small quantities
		- was informed that this was not a problem
	
ASSEMBLY NOTES
	See BOM for components & datasheet links
	All components not filled out on BOM are generic passives - any which meet the specified characteristics will do
	Connectors can be swapped for identical footprint versions if desired
