Issues to go through
	Antenna Connections?
		How are they going to connect to tray 1 and 5?
			Should this be worked out now?
			Or wait till Antenna guy joins BlueSat (if ever)?
	Powering the transmitter/recievers
//		Both on at the same time - wasted power/ interference?
//		Does CSC choose?
		Separate power supplies - YES
	D-sub wires
		Maximum current that it can handle
		Separating ground and power lines?
	Telemetry
		How much?
		Where?
		My problem/integration teams
	Radios
		D-subs provided
		Build D-Sub connectors for the radios
	Batteries
		Current - large amounts? - need to be split into multiple lines?
		Fluctuating voltages?
